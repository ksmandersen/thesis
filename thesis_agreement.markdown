# Title

## Background

<!-- Include references to earlier projects and current research in bAir.

Air quality is a major concern in terms of personal health and environmental factors.
Over the yeras Air quality has declined with the introduction of more and more cars and other polution sources in the bigger cities. In more recent years the air quality has improved with the introduction of green initiatives.
In several reports from the Department of Health in Denmark it has been found that the cititzens that breathe the most poluted air are the people on the roads. Several reports suggest that cyclists are the most exposed.
In Copenhagen the air quality is measured and monitored only on 3 different streets by the Deparment of Health.
Multiple projects have sought to provide a solution for measuring personal air quality in the past:

[Andersen2012] A. Andersen, P. Krøgholt, S. Bierre, A. Tabard, NoxDroid – A Bicycle Sensor System for Air Pollution Monitoring
[Hansen2014] K. Hansen, N. Kuraszynska, SiNOxSense: A textile-based wearable simple NOx sensing system
[Tudose2011] Tudose et al, Mobile Sensors in Air Pollution Measurement
[AlAli2009] A. Al-Ali, A Mobile GPRS-Sensors Array for Air Pollution Monitoring

At ITU a new project based on the prior research done with NoxDroid is currently running, called bAIR. In this project most problems with prior projects for personal air quality measurements are being addressed such as:

- Sensor sensitivity
- Power consumption
- Casing for the sensor
- Calibration
- Infrastructure for local and Cloud storage

One aspect that has not been rigorously covered is the user experience, the usability of the sensor system and the evaluation of the system by users.
