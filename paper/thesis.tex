\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Air quality is a major concern in terms of personal health and environmental factors. Over the years Air quality has declined with the introduction of more and more cars and other pollution sources in the bigger cities. In more recent years the air quality has improved with the introduction of green initiatives. In several reports from the Department of Health in Denmark it has been found that the citizens that breathe the most polluted air are the people on the roads. Several reports suggest that cyclists are the most exposed. In Copenhagen the air quality is measured and monitored only on 3 different streets by the Department of Health. 

At ITU a new project based on the prior research done with NoxDroid is currently running, called bAIR. In this project most problems with prior projects for personal air quality measurements are being addressed such as: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Sensor sensitivity 
\item Power consumption 
\item Casing for the sensor 
\item Calibration 
\item Infrastructure for local and Cloud storage 
\end{itemize}

One aspect that has not been rigorously covered is the user experience, the usability of the sensor system and the evaluation of the system by users.
