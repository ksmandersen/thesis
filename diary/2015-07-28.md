of the paper of papers  that are most relevant check references and potentially dig deeper.
2-3-5 research questions (or problems) is the goal to present in the beginning of thesis. in the end of the thesis a results in which you will refer back to say some of the questions (ideally answer the questions). Strong link between questions and findings. Return to research questions reguarly. ven diagram on second page of related work (areas that are relevant for your project). 2-3-4-5 circles/areas that are relevant for your work.

1. air pullution (stats) cities
2. crowdsourcing - methods, problems
3. mobile computing, wearable
4. maybe interaction design / Usability / HCI as a circle

related work is not only the bAir related work. Should also swow/connect to research areas that help you, that you can draw from. Include theories, methods from existing research areas that you need to consider using when you are adressing the problems / answering the research questions. 

try to reflect on what are the relevant research questions. with the kind of evaluation i think i will do what are the research questions I think I can answer.

sent thomas whatever I have written down a couple of days before we meet next time. 

user interface design iterations a couple of these with not too extensive evaluations. the system might fail because it is a little to hard to use. it is better if it fails because the context is not quite right. the market is not ready. this is not the right target group. maybe shift the long term study a bit more towards the end.

get going with a mockup or something user facing as soon as possible. package this in a way so the long term study will be smooth.

in the timeplan you might want to do a pilot long term study. use it yourself for a week, what are the problems with simply using it everyday.
